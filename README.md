# Bank

Bank is a redesign of the home page of GTBank.

The homepage of GTBank website is indeed very beautiful, i was very impressed with the way the designers/developers were able to conceal large chunk of information and links. I think the homepage is clean, very pleasing and more importantly, it is very easy to locate information. 

However, I observed that Gtbank website is not very responsive (no breakpoints at all); although, they have a different website developed for mobile users. But still, the mobile site design looks very poor and too slow on mobile devices. Being a big fan of mobile first designs, I re-designed a responsive layout suitable for different sizes of screen. 

The goal was to design a quick and responsive layout that masks information on smaller screens, and ensuring that there isnâ€™t going to be much compromise on the amount of information that can be accessed on a smaller screen when compared with what is obtainable on a larger screen.

The was what the bank's mobile site looks like- ![](images/GTBank_mobile_old.JPG "GTBank Old Mobile site")

**_(Update)_** Between the time of my observation and when i commenced on redesigning the homepage, GTBank had already re-designed to make the website more responsive. However, despite these new changes it is still not as good as you would expect from a top organisation.
