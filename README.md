## Bank | Homepage responsive redesign
Bank is a redesign of the home page of GTBank.

The GTBank website is a very beautiful website, i was very impressed with the way the designers/developers were able to conceal large chunk of information and links. I think the homepage is very clean, beautiful and more importantly users would find it very easy to locate information. 

However, I observed that Gtbank website is not responsive (no breakpoints); they have a different website developed for mobile users. But still the mobile site design looks very poor and too slow on mobile devices. Being a big fan of mobile first designs, I re-designed a more responsive layout for smaller screens. Whenever the website detects smaller screens it will readjust the display.

The goal is to design a quick and responsive layout that masks information on smaller screens, and ensuring that there isnâ€™t going to be much compromise on the amount of information that can be accessed on a smaller screen when compared with what is obtainable on a larger screen.

_(Update)_ Between the time i observed this and the time i commenced on the redesign, GTBank had re-designed to make this website more responsive. However, despite these new changes it is still not as good as you would expect from a top organisation like them.
